<title>Secure flag &amp; HttpOnly</title>
</head><body>secure flag doesn't allow a cookie to be transfered in clear text, so if you're using https and someone decrypts it, he still wont be able to see the cookie in clear text<br/>
<br/>
HttpOnly means that the cookie cannot be accessed through the client side script (doesn't allow xss to steal the cookie)</body></html>
