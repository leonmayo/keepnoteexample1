<title>scan</title>
</head><body>right click on the url and start an active vulnerablity scan<br/>
used to be called spyder<br/>
<br/>
crawl - just find interesting stuff<br/>
audit is active vulnerability testing<br/>
<b>audit is not a free feature</b><br/>
<b>also BAPP STORE also has many pro only extenstions</b><br/>
after crawling you can see the robots.txt file and look for disallowed urls<br/>
<br/>
<b>if you make any admin requests, for example add or delete a user or do anything to a db while burp is running, burp will log it and when you use active scan it will repeate those requests and even change these requests thus you might end up deleting a db or some user or so<br/>
<br/>
for example if you log in to asite with multifactor authentication site - like recieving an sms everytime you try to log in, an active scan after such a login will send tons of authentication sms's</b></body></html>
